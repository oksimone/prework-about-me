      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi pals! My name is Kristian, I graduated from the University of North Carolina Wilmington in the 
        spring of 2019 with a BA degree in Communication Studies. I am enrolled in this bootcamp because during my time
        at UNCW, I minored in Digital Arts and I thoroughly enjoyed the programming classes that I took, and
        decided to embark on a new journey/career transition.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Charlotte, NC</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Before COVID, I enjoyed working out at the gym, hanging out with friends, 
      sitting in coffee shops, enjoying the outdoors while being surrounded by other outdoorsy people lol. But since quarantine,
      I've enjoyed puzzling, running more (I signed up to run another half in September) and I've enjoyed refreshing my memory of the coding
      knowledge that I learned in school :)
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to become a front end web developer. But for now, I'm going to 
        go with the flow and see what direction my sails point me to. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Charlotte.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The aspect of seeing the result of a finished web page(s) brings me joy. Even though 
        there will be barriers to break, challenges to overcome, it'll all be worth it in the end.
